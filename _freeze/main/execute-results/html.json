It is not at all uncommon to see AI or other algorithmic solutions be used for corporate or societal contexts. For one, the results of a certain algorithm or model can be used to establish certain policies. However, within a societal or political context, this does not always happen in a standardised, constructive, or transparent way. This can sometimes lead to ignorance, malpractice or even abuse when it comes down to executing such a policy. Subsequently, if something goes wrong, finding out what went wrong and potentially fixing the problem can be a costly endeavour. On top of this, a certain blame or judicial consequence can entail such infractions.\n\nIn this research document, an overview is given of several relevant topics, fields and projects that exemplify or support the need for an open view of processes, with a focus on processes that deal with (public) data. Moreover, different principles are highlighted that will support a [framework/set of requirements] for a process to mitigate the risk of bias, malpractice and obscurity and to maximize stakeholder participation, process transparency, and traceability of decisions. In the end, this [framework/set of requirements] will be validated by showcasing a proof of concept that substantiates the intended purposes.\n\n## Open Science and Science for Policy\n### Open Software/Hardware\n### Trustworthy/explainable AI\n### Woo/wob, Open Overheid\n#### Country comparison on E-gov standards and practices?\n### Inclusive participation\n#### Scope (what cases and respective stakeholders does/can this apply to) / Stakeholder analysis (requirements)\n#### Citizen science and participation\n\n## Robust Incident Handling\n### What is it / Context\n### Example: Air Safety Investigation\n### Example: Food and Drug Administration (w.r.t. restaurant hygiene inspections)\n### Example: Software development principles\n\n## Steps within a Data Science process and their biases \n### Data acquisition\n### Data filtering and selection\n### Algorithmic development/implementation\n### Algorithmic application\n### Results handling\n\n## Requirements (engineering)\n### What have you learned from [policy/open science], [social safety] and [data processes] that we can translate into a set of requirements (for what)?\n### What platform could facilitate the above-stated requirements?
