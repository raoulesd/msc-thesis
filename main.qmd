## Abstract
Lorum ipsum.

## Introduction

## Open Science and Science for Policy
### Open Software/Hardware
### Trustworthy/explainable AI
### Woo/wob, Open Overheid
#### Country comparison on E-gov standards and practices?
### Inclusive participation
#### Scope (what cases and respective stakeholders does/can this apply to) / Stakeholder analysis (requirements)
#### Citizen science and participation

## Robust Incident Handling
### What is it / Context
### Example: Air Safety Investigation
### Example: Food and Drug Administration (w.r.t. restaurant hygiene inspections)
### Example: Software development principles

## Steps within a Data Science process and their biases 
### Data acquisition
### Data filtering and selection
### Algorithmic development/implementation
### Algorithmic application
### Results handling

## Requirements (engineering)
### What have you learned from [policy/open science], [social safety] and [data processes] that we can translate into a set of requirements (for what)?
### What platform could facilitate the above-stated requirements? What would need to be made/adjusted/fine-tuned to be able to meet all/most requirements?

## Application on existing processesâ€™
### TBD case

## Proof of concept by example
### Own process with sample data, own stakeholder. Try to cover as many requirements as possible. WIP0

## Results and conclusion
